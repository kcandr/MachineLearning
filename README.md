================
ID3
----------------

    An implementation of the ID3 algorithm in C++
####Input data
        In first row of input file there is integer N, M number of attributes and row count.
        In second row there is N names of attributes.
        In next M rows there is numbers {0, 1} separated with spaces.
####Output data
        Decision tree will be shown in console
Logistic Regression
----------------

	An implementation of the Logistic Regression algorithm with linear dependence Θ1*x1 + Θ2*x2 + ...+ Θn*xn
####Input data
        In first row of input file there is integer N, M number of attributes and row count.
        In second row there is N names of attributes.
        In next M rows there is numbers separated with spaces.
####Output data
        Cost at initial theta, cost at theta found by gradient descent and list values of theta will be shown in console
